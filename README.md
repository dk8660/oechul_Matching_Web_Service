## Objectives and Value Proposition

- Reactivate offline networking and social relationships among university students disrupted by the pandemic.
- Overcome limitations of traditional group matchmaking systems dependent on personal introductions by seniors.
- Offer exclusive group matching (3:3 or 4:4) functionality not available in existing matchmaking platforms.
- Enable users to meet people with shared interests based on personality profiles (MBTI) and preferences.
- Provide an option for instant "speed matching" to encourage immediate meetups.

## Product and Service Features

### Matching System

- Users input personal information and preferences (e.g., purpose, region, MBTI).
- A proprietary matching algorithm calculates match scores and suggests the best-suited candidates.
- The matching score system applies weights based on user-defined priorities to produce optimized match results.

### Group Matching

- Supports team-based matchmaking: users can form their own group and apply as a team.
- Other groups of similar size and characteristics are suggested as match candidates.
- If the group sizes are unequal, a "party system" allocates remaining seats with compatible users.
- Unlike existing offline university group meetups, this system prioritizes structured, algorithm-based pairing.

### Additional Capabilities (Planned for Full Release)

- School verification and login authentication
- Calendar integration for meeting schedule management
- Advertisement system and monetization strategy
- National-scale coverage beyond the HUFS beta test

## Technical Strength

- All components are fully self-developed: frontend, backend, database, and algorithm
- Easy to maintain and expand with new features
- Faster issue resolution and customizability compared to third-party tools
- Group matchmaking as a unique, service-differentiating feature
